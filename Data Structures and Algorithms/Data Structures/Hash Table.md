## Introduction

Hashing is a process of mapping an element/data to a specific index through the means of a hash function, which gives a certain output for a certain input. This enables fast access to information based on the element's key. Algorithms like searching, insertion and deletion on this data structure has a time complexity of $O(1)$. This is used for key-value pairs.
