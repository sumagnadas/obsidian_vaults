# [[Supervised Machine Learning|Supervised Machine Learning]]
---
A type of machine learning where both input and output data is given and then we have to predict output based on test data
# [[Unsupervised Machine Learning]]
---
A type of machine learning where only input data is given with no knowledge of output data or what to output
# [[Semi-supervised Machine Learning/Semi-supervised Machine Learning|Semi-supervised Machine Learning]]
---
All input data is given and model starts linking them and then only gets one label and sets it to all of them for the future and past links.
Eg. Google photos face labeling.

No input data and starts from scratch. We give test straight and reward it for correct and penalize it for incorrect action.
