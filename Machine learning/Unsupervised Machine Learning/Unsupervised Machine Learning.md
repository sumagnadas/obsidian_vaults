There are mainly four types of Unsupervised Machine Learning:-
- [[Clustering|Clustering]] -> Clusters data based on similarity and categorizes them. Eg. Those who buy cosmetics more, or buys sports items more are grouped 
- [[Dimensionality Reduction|Dimensionality reduction]] -> Reduces n-number of columns/dimensions to only 1 column(somehow categorize them or something). Eg. PCA
- [[Anomaly Detection]] -> Predict outliers based on data?
- [[Association Rule Learning]] -> Associate variables with one another and discover unseen relationships between variables. Eg. Person buys item Y if they already bought item X (If X then Y).
