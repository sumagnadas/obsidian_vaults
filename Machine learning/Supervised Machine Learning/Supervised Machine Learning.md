In supervised machine learning, We mostly train with datasets which already have a clear outline of what input they give to the model and what output we need from it. Like giving the model someone's CGPA and asking to predict how much package they might get if they are placed or if they will even get placed.

There are basically two types of Supervised Machine Learning(as far as my knowledge goes right now) :-
- [[Regression|Regression]] -> Predict numerical data (how much Package they will get)
- [[Classification]] -> Predict categorical data (whether they will get placed or not)
-
