# 🛡️ Introduction

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Vault** — a personal Obsidian knowledge base for learning and practicing cybersecurity, with a hands-on and foundational-first approach.

This vault includes notes on topics like **Operating Systems**, **Networking**, **Web Exploitation**, **Vulnerability Research**, and **Security Tools**, all built as I study, break things, and fix them.

> ⚠️ This vault is evolving. Notes may be incomplete, full of questions, or revised later — that's the point.

## 🧠 Philosophy

- 🚧 **Work-in-Progress by Design**: Everything here is a snapshot of my current understanding, open to edits and errors.
- 🧪 **Experiment First, Read Later**: Learning by doing, debugging, and documenting.
- 🔍 **Atomic Notes**: Each file focuses on one core idea, concept, tool, or exploit.
- 🧵 **Interlinked Knowledge**: Most notes link to others via `[[Wikilinks]]` for layered understanding.

├── [[Operating Systems]]
├── [[Networking]]
├── [[Web Security]]
├── [[Exploitation Lab]]
├── [[Tools and Commands]]
└── [[Cybersecurity Vault]]
## 🧭 Navigation Tips

- Use the **Graph View** to explore cross-topic links
- Tag key concepts: `#exploit`, `#networking`, `#linux`, `#tool`
- Use `[[Daily Notes]]` for tracking lab experiments or failure logs
- Start each topic with a root note (like `[[Networking]]`) that links outward

## ✅ Future Plans

- Create a [[Red Team vs Blue Team]] simulation setup
- Reproduce real-world CVEs and document them
- Build custom scripts for enumeration and automation
- Deep dive into [[Kernel Exploitation]] later
## 🧷 Reminder to Self

> “If you didn’t write it down, you didn’t really learn it.”

- Always note what failed and *why*
- Don’t just copy-paste commands — annotate them
- Connect concepts backward and forward in the vault
- When in doubt, make a new atomic note — refactor later
